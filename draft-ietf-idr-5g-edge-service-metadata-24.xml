    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes a new Metadata Path Attribute and some Sub-TLVs
      for egress routers to advertise the Metadata about the attached edge
      services (ES). The edge service Metadata can be used by the ingress
      routers in the 5G Local Data Network to make path selections not only
      based on the routing cost but also the running environment of the edge
      services. The goal is to improve latency and performance for 5G edge
      services.</t>

      <t>The extension enables an edge service at one specific location to be
      more preferred than the others with the same IP address (ANYCAST) to
      receive data flow from a specific source, like a specific User Equipment
      (UE).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes a new Metadata Path Attribute added to a BGP
      UPDATE message <xref target="RFC4271"/> for egress routers to advertise
      the Metadata about 5G low latency edge services directly attached to the
      egress routers. 5G <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>is characterized by
      having edge services closer to the Cell Towers reachable by Local Data
      Networks (LDN). From an IP network perspective, the 5G LDN is a limited
      domain <xref target="RFC8799"/> with edge services a few hops away from
      the ingress nodes. Only selective UE services are considered as 5G low
      latency edge services.</t>

      <t>Note: The proposed edge service Metadata Path Attribute are not
      intended for the best-effort services reachable via the public Internet.
      The information carried by the Metadata Path Attribute can be used by
      the ingress routers to make path selections for selective low latency
      services based on not only the network distance but also the running
      environment of the edge cloud sites. The goal is to improve latency and
      performance for 5G ultra-low latency services.</t>

      <t>This extension is targeted for a single domain with a BGP Route
      Reflector (RR) <xref target="RFC4456"/>  controlling the
      propagation of the BGP UPDATEs. The edge service Metadata Path Attribute
      is only attached to the low latency services (routes) hosted in the 5G
      edge cloud sites. These routes are only a small subset of services initiated
      from UEs, not for UEs accessing many internet sites.</t>

      <t>While the proposed Metadata Path Attribute is particularly beneficial
      for low latency services, the Metadata Path Attributes can be expanded
      to propagate information about GPU availability, power, or other
      resources necessary for compute-intensive services such as AI and
      machine learning. This flexibility makes it a valuable tool for a wide
      range of applications beyond just low latency services when used within a
      limited domain network.</t>

    <section title="Metadata Influenced Ingress Node Behavior">
      <t>The goal of this edge service Metadata Path Attribute is for egress
      routers to propagate the metrics about the running environment for a
      subset of edge services to ingress routers so that the ingress routers
      can make path selections based on not only the routing cost but also the
      running environment for those edge services. The BGP speakers that do
      not support the Metadata Path Attribute can ignore the Metadata Path
      Attribute in a BGP UPDATE Message. All intermediate nodes can forward
      the entire BGP UPDATE as it is. Multiple metrics can be attached to one
      Metadata Path Attribute. One Metadata Path Attribute can contain
      computing service capability information, computing service states,
      computing resource states of the corresponding edge site, or more.
      Computing service capability information can be used to record
      information of the computing power node or initialization deployment
      information for computing service initialization. Computing service
      states can include one of the service connection numbers, service
      duration, and so on. Computing resource states can be detailed
      information on computing resources such as CPU/GPU. They can also be an
      abstract metric from these detailed parameters to indicate the resource
      status of the edge site. There could be more metrics about the running
      environment being attached to the Metadata Path Attribute; e.g., some of
      the metrics being discussed by the IETF CATS Working Group. This document
      illustrates a few examples of Sub-TLVs of the metrics under the edge
      service Metadata Path Attribute:</t>

      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="-">the site physical availability index</t>

        <t hangText="-">the site preference index</t>

        <t hangText="-">the service delay predication index x, and</t>

        <t hangText="-">the raw load measurement.</t>
      </list>

      <t>This section specifies how those Metadata impact the ingress node's
      path selections.</t>

      <section title="Metadata Influenced BGP Path Selection">
        <t>When an ingress router receives BGP UPDATEs for the same IP prefix
        from multiple egress routers, all these egress routers' loopback
        addresses are considered as the next hops for the IP prefix. For the
        selected low latency edge services, the ingress router BGP engine
        would call an edge service Management function that can select paths
        based on the edge service Metadata received. Section 5.1 has an
        exemplary algorithm to compute the weighted path cost based on the
        edge service Metadata carried by the Sub-TLV(s) specified in this
        document.</t>

        <t>Section 5 has the detailed description of the edge service Metadata
        influenced optimal path selection.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Ingress Router Forwarding Behavior">
        <t>When the ingress router receives a packet and does a lookup on the
	route in the FIB, it determines the destination prefix's entire path
	including the optimal egress node.  The ingress router encapsulates the
	packet destined towards the optimal egress router.
	For routes that carry the Metadata Path Attribute but lack the 
	<xref target="RFC9012">Tunnel Encapsulation Path Attribute </xref>, it
	is recommended that the ingress router encapsulate the original packet
	using an IP-in-IP header. This encapsulation ensures that intermediate
	nodes not supporting the Metadata Path Attribute do not forward the
	packet to unintended destinations. The outer header should set the
	destination address to the optimal egress router and the source address
	to the ingress router.</t>

	<t>For routes without the Metadata Path Attribute, no changes are
	required. Packets are forwarded according to existing behavior:
	encapsulation is applied when Tunnel Attributes are present, and
	parkets are forwarded without encapsulation when they are not.</t>

        <t>For subsequent packets belonging to the same flow, the ingress
        router needs to forward them to the same egress router unless the
        selected egress router is no longer reachable. Forwarding packets for a particular
        flow to the same egress router, also known as Flow Affinity, is supported
        by many commercial routers. Most registered EC services have
        relatively short-lived flows.</t>

        <t>How Flow Affinity is implemented is out of the scope for this
        document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Forwarding Behavior when UEs Move">
        <t>When a UE moves to a new 5G gNB which is anchored to the same UPF,
        the packets from the UE traverse to the same ingress router. Path
        selection and forwarding behavior are same as before.</t>

        <t>If the UE maintains the same IP address when anchored to a new UPF,
        the directly connected ingress router might use the information passed
        from a neighboring router to derive the optimal BGP Next Hop for this
        route. The detailed algorithm is out of the scope of this
        document.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Edge Service Metadata Encoding">
      <section title="Metadata Path Attribute">
        <t>The Metadata Path Attribute is an optional non-transitive BGP Path
        attribute that carries metrics and metadata about the edge services
        attached to the egress router. The Metadata Path Attribute, to be
        assigned by IANA <xref target="RFC2042"/>, consists of a set of
        Sub-TLVs, and each Sub-TLV contains information for specific metrics
        of the edge services.</t>

	<t>The fields within the Metadata Path Attribute and its Sub-TLVs MUST
	use network byte order (big-endian), where the most significant byte is
	transmitted first.</t>

        <section title="Metadata Path Attribute Characteristics">
          <t>Only a small subset of BGP UPDATE messages include the Metadata
          Path Attribute. The choice of which prefix to carry the Metadata
          Path Attribute is determined by local policies. The Metadata Path
          Attribute can be included in a BGP UPDATE message <xref
          target="RFC4271"/> together with other BGP Path Attributes <xref
          target="IANA-BGP-PARAMS"/>, such as Communities <xref
          target="RFC4360"/>, NEXT_HOP, Tunnel Encapsulation Path Attribute
          <xref target="RFC9012"/>, etc.</t>

          <t>The Metadata Path Attribute has the following
          characteristics:</t>

          <list style="hanging">

            Multiple Metadata Sub-TLVs can be included in a Metadata Path

            present in the BGP Metadata Path Attribute is determined by the

            Metadata Path Attribute.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Metadata Path Attribute Processing">
	  <t>A BGP speaker that advertises a BGP UPDATE message received from
	  one of its neighbors SHOULD advertise the BGP Metadata Path Attribute
	  received with the UPDATE message without modification only when
	  forwarding to peers within the same domain. Otherwise, the Metadata
	  Path Attribute should be removed. If the UPDATE message did not come
	  with a BGP Metadata Path Attribute, the speaker MAY attach a BGP
	  Metadata Path Attribute to the UPDATE message, if configured to do so,
	  provided that the modification adheres to the domain's policies and
	  security guidelines.</t>
	  <!-- XXX JMH Issue 34 - this is a place where the procedures need to be
	  subject to the Limited Domain principle.  How do you want to discuss
	  that check here? -->

          <t>A BGP Peer receiving a BGP Metadata Path Attribute should ignore
          Sub-TLVs with unknown types and process the recognized Sub-TLVs. BGP
          Peers should not delete any Sub-TLV from the BGP Metadata Path
          Attribute.</t>

	  <t>To prevent forwarding loops and ensure consistent routing
	  decisions, it is essential that all BGP peers within an Autonomous
	  System (AS) adopt a unified approach to handling BGP Metadata Path
	  Attributes. Specifically, BGP peers should consistently ignore
	  Sub-TLVs with unknown types while processing the recognized Sub-TLVs.
	  Additionally, BGP peers should refrain from deleting any Sub-TLV from
	  the BGP Metadata Path attribute. This ensures that all peers have a
	  common understanding of the routing information and reduces the risk
	  of routing inconsistencies that could lead to forwarding loops.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Sub-TLVs Data Processing">
          <t>By default, a BGP speaker does not report any unrecognized
          Sub-TLVs within a Metadata Path Attribute unless configured to send
          a notification to its management system. The ingress node should be
          configured with an algorithm to combine the recognized metrics
          carried by the Sub-TLVs within a Metadata Path Attribute of the
          received BGP UPDATE message.</t>

	  <t>To ensure consistent route selection, a deployment-specific
	  algorithm should be configured across all ingress nodes to factor in
	  the Metadata's contribution alongside existing policies. This will
	  help the ingress node make informed decisions about the optimal path
	  to the next-hop, considering both traditional routing factors and the
	  additional insights provided by the Metadata.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Metadata Path Attribute Handling Procedure">
          <t>The Metadata Path Attribute MUST contain at least one metadata
          Sub-TLV. Multiple Metadata Sub-TLVs can be included in a Metadata
          Path Attribute in one BGP UPDATE message. The content of the
          Sub-TLVs present in the BGP Metadata Path Attribute is determined by
          configuration.  The domain ingress nodes should process the
          recognized Sub-TLVs carried by the Metadata Path Attribute and
          ignore the unrecognized Sub-TLVs. By default, a BGP speaker does not
          report any unrecognized Sub-TLVs within a Metadata Path Attribute
          unless configured to send a notification to its management system.
          The ingress router should be configured with an algorithm to consider

      <section title="The Site Preference Index Sub-TLV">
        <t>Different services might have different preference index values
        configured for the same site. For example, Service-A requires high
        computing power, Service-B requires high bandwidth among its
        microservices, and Service-C requires high volume storage capacity.
        For a DC with relatively low storage capacity but high bisectional
        bandwidth, its preference index value for Service-B is higher and
        lower for Service-C. Site Preference Index can also be used to achieve

      <section title="Site Physical Availability Index Metadata">
        <t>The Site Physical Availability Index indicates the percentage of
        impact on a group of routes associated with a common physical
        characteristic, for example, a pod, a row of server racks, a floor, or
        an entire DC. The purpose is to use one UPDATE message to indicate a
        group of routes of different NLRIs impacted by a physical event. For
        example, a power outage to a pod can cause the Site Physical
        Availability Index to be 0% for all the routes in the pod. Partial
        fiber cut to a row of shelves can cause the Site Physical Availability
        Index to be 50% for all the routes in those shelves. The value is 0-100,
        with 100% indicating the site is fully functional, 0% indicating the
        site is entirely out of service, and 50% indicating the site is 50%
        degraded.</t>

	<t>It is recommended to assign each route with one Site-ID. When a
	route is associated with multiple Site-IDs, the latest BGP UPDATE will
	override any previous associations. For example, one DC can use POD
	number as Site-ID, another DC can use Row of Shelves as the
	Site-ID.</t>

        <t>Cloud Site/Pod failures and degradation include, but are not limited
        to, a site degradation or an entire site going down caused by a
        variety of reasons. Examples include fiber cuts impacting a  site or among
        pods, cooling failures, insufficient backup power, cyber threats
        attacks, too many changes outside of the maintenance window, etc.
        Fiber-cuts are not uncommon within a Cloud site or between sites.</t>

        <t>When those failure events happen, the edge (egress) router is
        running fine. Therefore, the ingress routers with paths to the egress
        router can't use BFD to detect the failures.</t>
	<!-- XXX JMH Issue 36 - This depends on how BFD is being used.  BFD can report
	"concatenated paths down" in some circumstances.  Please describe where
	BFD is being used in this scenario. -->

        <t>When there is a failure occurring at an edge site (or a pod), many
        instances can be impacted. In addition, the routes (i.e., the IP
        addresses) in the site might not be aggregated nicely. Instead of many
        BGP UPDATE messages to the ingress routers for all the instances, i.e.
        routes, impacted, the egress router can send one single BGP UPDATE to
        indicate the capacity availability of the site. The ingress routers
        can switch all or a portion of the instances associated with the site
        depending on how much the site is degraded.</t>

        <t>The BGP UPDATE for the individual instances (i.e., the routes) can
        include the Capacity Availability Index solely for ingress routers to
        associate the routes with the Side-ID. The actual Capacity
        Availability Index value, i.e., the percentage for all the routes
        associated with the Side-ID, is generated by the egress routers with
        the egress routers' loopback address as the NLRI.</t>

        <t>The Site Physical Availability Index Sub-TLV has fixed length of 8
        Octets, including the Type field. Therefore a Length field is not
        needed.</t>

      <section title="Service-Oriented Capability Sub-TLV">
        <t>The service-oriented capability Sub-TLV is for distributing
        information regarding the capabilities of a specific service in a
        deployment environment. Depending on the deployment, a deployment
        environment can be an edge site or other types of environments. This
        information provides ingress routers or controllers with the available
        resources for the specific service in each deployment environment. It
        enables them to make well-informed decisions for the optimal paths to the selected deployment environment.</t>
		<t>Currently, the Sub-TLV only has
        an abstract value derived from various metrics, although the specifics
        of this derivation are beyond the scope of this document. Importantly,
        this value is significant only when comparing multiple data center
        sites for the same service. This value is not meaningful when comparing
        different services, meaning the capability value relevant to Service A
        cannot be directly compared with that for Service B. Future
        enhancements may expand this sub-TLV to include more types of metrics
        or even raw data that represents direct metrics. This information is
        important in 5G network environments where efficient resource
        utilization is crucial for enhancing performance and service
        quality.</t>

          Sub-TLV is ignored. For example, Capacity value is 50 and the
          SO-AvailRes is 50 when P-flag is set, it means 50% of 50 unit of
          resource is available, while 25 unit of resource is available in
          this site for the service. When the P-flag is 0, then the value of
          this filed is the abstract value of the available resource. For
          example, When the capacity value is 50, and the SO-AvailRes is 50,
          it means all the resource is available.</t>
        </list>

        <t>Multiple Service-Oriented Available Resource Sub-TLVs with
        different metric types can be encoded in a Metadata Path Attribute,
        indicating that multiple metrics are carried. However, if more than
        one Service-Oriented Available Resource Sub-TLVs with the same metric
        type are encoded in a Metadata Path Attribute, only the first one will
        be processed and the others will be ignored in processing.</t>

    <section title="Service Metadata Propagation Scope">
      <t>The propagation scope of the Metadata Path Attribute needs careful consideration to ensure it does not inadvertently leak to other BGP domains. According to Section 3 of <xref target="ATTRIBUTE-ESCAPE"/>, it is necessary for the Route Reflector (RR) to be upgraded to constrain the propagation scope when propagating the metadata path attributes. Therefore, the Metadata Path Attribute originator sets the attribute as Non-transitive when sending the BGP UPDATE message to its corresponding RR. Non-transitive attributes are only guaranteed to be dropped during BGP route propagation by implementations that do not recognize them, ensuring that the metadata path attributes do not propagate beyond the intended scope.
	  </t>
	  <t>The RR can append the NO-ADVERTISE well-known community to the BGP UPDATE message with the Metadata Path Attribute when forwarding it to the ingress routers. This signals to the ingress nodes that the associated route's Metadata Path Attribute should not be further advertised beyond their scope. This precautionary measure ensures that the receiver of the BGP UPDATE message refrains from forwarding the received update to its peers, preventing the undesired propagation of the information carried by the Metadata Path Attribute.

	  <section title = "AS-Scope SubTLV">
	  <t>To address the potential issue where the NO-ADVERTISE well-known community of the BGP UPDATE message can be dropped by some routers, a new AS-Scope Sub-TLV can be included in the Metadata Path Attribute to prevent the Metadata Path Attribute from being leaked to unintended Autonomous Systems (ASes). The AS-Scope Sub-TLV will enforce stricter control over the propagation of the metadata by associating it with specific AS numbers.</t>

        <t> - If the AS value matches the local AS or a recognized AS in its configuration, the router will process the update as usual. If the AS value does not match or is not recognized, the router SHOULD NOT process the Metadata Path Attribute values in the BGP UDPATE and SHOULD NOT propagate the received BGP UPDATE to other nodes.  I.e., treat-as-withdraw behavior will be used.</t>
		
		<t> Example Usage:</t>
        <t>Consider a scenario where a router in AS 65001 advertises a BGP UPDATE message with the AS-Scope Sub-TLV set to AS 65001. When another router in AS 65002 receives this UPDATE, it will check the AS-Scope Sub-TLV value:</t>

        <t>Since AS 65002 does not match the AS value 65001, the router in AS 65002 will drop the UPDATE, preventing the metadata from leaking into AS 65002.</t>

    <section title="Minimum Interval for Metrics Change Advertisement">
	  <t>Route Churn Considerations</t>

	  <t> While the mechanism detailed in this document aims to provide dynamic metrics like Capacity Availability Index, Site Delay Prediction Index, Service Delay Prediction Index, and Raw Measurement to optimize path selection, it is essential to consider the broader implications of metric-induced churn. Particularly, in the context of routes used for BGP nexthop resolution (e.g., labeled unicast), frequent changes in these metrics can lead to significant churn not only for the prefixes carrying the data but also for dependent routes.</t>

      <t>This behavior is analogous to the impacts observed with RSVP auto-bandwidth, which can introduce considerable instability within a network. Such route churn can propagate through the network, causing a cascade of UPDATEs and potential route flaps, thereby affecting overall network stability and performance.</t>

	  <t>To mitigate these effects, network operators should carefully manage the advertisement intervals of these dynamic metrics, ensuring they are set to avoid unnecessary churn. The default minimum interval for metrics change advertisement, set at 30 seconds, is designed to balance responsiveness with stability. However, in scenarios with higher sensitivity to route stability, operators may consider increasing this interval further to reduce the frequency of UPDATEs.</t>

	  <t>Significant load changes at EC data centers can be triggered by
      short-term gatherings of UEs, like conventions, lasting a few hours or
      days. Therefore, a high metrics change rate can persist for hours or days.</t>

      <t>The Metadata Path Attribute is an optional non-transitive BGP Path

      <t>When more than one sub-TLV is present in a Metadata Path Attribute,
      they are processed independently. Suppose a Metadata Path Attribute can

	<section title = "Service Delay Prediction Based on Load Measurement">
	  <t>When data centers detailed running status are not exposed to the
	  network operator, historic traffic patterns through the egress routers
	  can be utilized to predict the load to a specific service. For
	  example, when traffic volume to one service at one data center
	  suddenly increases a huge percentage compared with the past 24 hours
	  average, it is likely caused by a larger than normal demand for the
	  service. When this happens, another data center with
	  lower-than-average traffic volume for the same service might have a
	  shorter processing time for the same service.</t>

	  <t>Here are some measurements that can be utilized to derive the
	  Service Delay Predication for a service ID:</t>

	  <list style="hanging">
		<t hangText="-">Total number of packets to the attached service
		instance (ToPackets);</t>

		<t hangText="-">Total number of packets from the attached service
		instance (FromPackets);</t>

		<t hangText="-">Total number of bytes to the attached service
		instance (ToBytes);</t>

		<t hangText="-">Total number of bytes from the attached service
		instance (FromBytes);</t>

		<t hangText="-">The actual load measurement to the service
		instance attached to an egress router can be based on one of the
		metrics above or including all four metrics with different weights
		applied to each, such as:</t>

		<t>LoadIndex =
		w1*ToPackets+w2*FromPackes+w3*ToBytes+w4*FromBytes</t>

		<t>Where w1/w2/w3/w4 are between 0-1. w1+ w2+ w3+ w4 = 1;</t>

		<t>The weights of each metric contributing to the index of the
		service instance attached to an egress router can be configured or
		learned by self-adjusting based on user feedbacks.</t>
	  </list>

	  <t>The Service Delay Prediction Index can be derived from
	  LoadIndex/24Hour-Average. A higher value means a longer delay
	  prediction. The egress router can use the ServiceDelayPred sub-TLV
	  to indicate to the ingress routers of the delay prediction derived
	  from the traffic pattern.</t>

	  <t>Note: The proposed IP layer load measurement is only an estimate
	  based on the amount of traffic through the egress router, which
	  might not truly reflect the load of the servers attached to the
	  egress routers. They are listed here only for some special
	  deployments where those metrics are helpful to the ingress routers
	  in selecting the optimal paths.</t>
	</section>
	    <section title="Service Metadata Influenced Decision Process">
      <section title="Egress Router Behavior">
        <t>Multiple instances of the same service could be attached to one
        egress router. When all instances of the same service are grouped
        behind one application layer load balancer, they appear as one single
        route to the egress router, i.e., the application loader balancer's
        prefix. Under this scenario, the compute metrics for all those
        instances behind one application layer balancer are aggregated under
        the application load balancer's prefix. In this case, the compute
        metrics aggregated by the Load Balancer are visible to the egress
        router as associated with the Load Balancer's prefix. However, how the
        application layer Load Balancers distribute the traffic among
        different instances is out of the scope of this document. When
        multiple instances of the same service have different paths or links
        reachable from the egress router, multiple groups of metrics from
        respective paths could be exposed to the egress router. The egress
        router can have preconfigured policies on aggregating various metrics
        from different paths and the corresponding policies in selecting a
        path for forwarding the packets received from ingress routers. The
        aggregated metrics can be carried in the BGP UPDATE messages instead
        of detailed measurements to reduce the entries advertised by the
        control plane and dampen the routes update in the forwarding plane.
        Upon receiving packets from ingress routers, the egress router can use
        its policies to choose an optimal path to one service instance. It is
        out of the scope of this document how the measurements are aggregated
        on egress routers and how ingress routers are configured with the
        algorithms to integrate the aggregated metrics with network layer
        metrics.</t>

        <t>Many measurements could impact and correspondingly reflect service
        performance. In order to simplify an optimal selection process, egress
        routers can have preconfigured policies or algorithms to aggregate
        multiple metrics into one simple one to ingress routers. Though out of
        the scope of this document, an egress router can also have an
        algorithm to convert multiple metrics to network metrics, an IGP cost
        for each instance, to pass to ingress nodes. This decision-making
        process integrates network metrics computed by traditional IGP/BGP and
        the service delay metrics from egress routers to achieve a
        well-informed and adaptive routing approach. This intelligent
        orchestration at the edge enhances the service's overall performance
        and optimizes resource utilization across the distributed
        infrastructure. When the egress has merged the compute metrics from
        the local sites behind it, it can include one or more aggregated
        compute metrics in the Metadata Path Attribute in the BGP UPDATE to
        the Ingress. Also, an identifier or flag can be carried to indicate
        that the metrics are merged ones. After receiving the routes for the
        Service ID with the identifier, the ingress would do the route
        selection based on pre-configured algorithms (see Section 3 of this
        document).</t>

        <t>As the service metrics and network delays are in different units,
        here is an exemplary algorithm for an ingress router to compare the
        cost to reach the service instances at Site-i or Site-j.</t>

                ServD-j * CP-i               Pref-i * NetD-j

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="CP-i:">Capacity Availability Index at Site-i. A higher
          value means higher capacity available.</t>

          <t hangText="NetD-i:">Network latency measurement (RTT) to the
          Egress Router at the site-i.</t>

          <t hangText="Pref-i:">Preference Index for Site-i, a higher value
          means higher preference.</t>

          <t hangText="ServD-i:">Service Delay Predication Index at Site-i for
          the service, i.e., the ANYCAST address [RFC4786] for the
          service.</t>

          <t hangText="w:">Weight is a value between 0 and 1. If smaller than
          0.5, Network latency and the site Preference have more influence;
          otherwise, Service Delay and capacity availability have more
          influence.</t>

        <t>When a set of service Metadata is converted to a simple metric, a
        decision process is determined by the metric semantics and deployment
        situations. The goal is to integrate the conventional network decision
        process with the service Metadata into a unified decision-making
        process for path selection.</t>

	<!-- XXX JMH Issue 40 - nothing in this document discusses integration into the
	custom decision process mechanism.  I'd suggest dropping the reference
	to it.  However, what you do need to do is discuss how this algorithm
	influences BGP route selection for the routes that contain the metadata
	attribute, how such routes compare vs. routes that DO NOT contain it.
	Also, this is a strong piece of normative behavior and needs to be in
	the main part of the document.-->
      <section title="Integrating with BGP decision process">
        <t>When an ingress router receives BGP UPDATEs for the same IP address
        from multiple egress routers, all those egress routers are considered
        as the next hops for the IP address. For the selected services
        configured to be influenced by the edge service Metadata, the ingress
        router BGP Decision process [IDR-CUSTOM-DECISION] would trigger the
        edge service Management function to compute the weight to be applied
        to the route's next hop in the forwarding plane. The decision process
        is influenced by the edge service Metadata associated with the client
        routes, such as Capacity Availability Index, Site Preference, and
        Service Delay Prediction Index, in addition to the traditional BGP
        multipath computation algorithm, such as the Weight, Local preference,
        Origin, MED, etc., shown below:</t>

        <t>When any of those metadata value goes to 0, the effect is the same
        as the routes becoming ineligible via the egress router who originates
        the metadata UPDATE. But when any of those metadata just degrade,
        there is possibility, even though smaller, for the egress router to
        continue as the optimal next hop.</t>

        <t>Suppose a destination address for aa08::4450 can be reached by
        three next hops (R1, R2, R3). Further, suppose the local BGP's
        Decision Process based on the traditional network layer policies and
        metrics identifies the R1 as the optimal next hop for this destination
        (aa08::4450). If the edge service Metadata results in R2 as the
        optimal next hop for the prefix, the Forwarding Plane will have R2 as
        the next-hop for the destination address of aa08::4450.</t>

        <t>The edge service Metadata influencing next hop selection is
        different from the metric (or weight) to the next hop. The metric to a
        next hop can impact many (sometimes, tens of thousands) routes that
        have the node as their next hop. while as the edge service Metadata
        only impact the optimal next hop selection for a subset of client
        routes that are identified as the edge services.</t>

        <t>When the BGP custom decision [idr-custom-decision] is used, the
        edge service Management function would have algorithm to combine the
        edge service Metadata attributes with the custom decision to derive
        the optimal next hop for the Edge service routes.</t>

        <t>Note: For a BGP UPDATE message that includes the edge service
        Metadata Path Attribute with the RouteFlag-I=0 and the egress router's
        loopback prefix as the NLRI, the Site Capacity Availability Index
        value is applied to all the routes associated with the Site-ID.</t>
